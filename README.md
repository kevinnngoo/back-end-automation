- Submits applications automatically using form autofill.
- Manages a database to store job application statuses, user preferences, and resume templates.
- Provides a RESTful API for the frontend to interact with.

This backend serves as the core logic and data processing layer for the project, allowing the frontend to retrieve and update data seamlessly.
